# Kotlin Trending Repositories
### Android App that lists trending Kotlin Github repositories

Since there is no official API for Trending Repositories (it is one of the internal GitHub APIâ€™s),
<br />
I have decided to use a [3rd party unofficial API](https://githubtrendingapi.docs.apiary.io/) that scrape the info from that trending section.
